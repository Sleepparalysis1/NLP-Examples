this time performing Machine Translation and explicitly using a model from the popular Helsinki-NLP collection.

We'll translate a sentence from English to French using a dedicated model fine-tuned for this language pair.

Prerequisites:

Ensure you have the necessary libraries. Helsinki-NLP models often use the sentencepiece tokenizer library.

Bash

pip install transformers sentencepiece torch
# Or: pip install transformers sentencepiece tensorflow
(Ensure your existing virtual environment is active).

Explicit Model Choice:

We will use Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-fr, a model specifically trained for English-to-French translation, part of the OPUS-MT project which provides many high-quality translation models. These models are often quite efficient.

How to Run:

Make sure you've run pip install transformers sentencepiece torch (or the tensorflow equivalent) in your activated virtual environment.
Save the code above into a file named run_translation.py.
Open your Ubuntu terminal.
Make sure your virtual environment is activated (source .venv/bin/activate).
Run the script:
Bash

python run_translation.py
What to Expect:

First Run: It will download the Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-fr model files. These models are usually more compact than BERT/BART large models (often a few hundred MB) and should download relatively quickly. The files will be cached locally.
Translation Execution: The model will process the input English sentence.
Output: It will print the original English text and then the resulting French translation generated by the model. For the example text, you should expect something like: "C'est un bel après-midi de vendredi ici à Perth, en Australie occidentale. Peut-être que j'irai me promener au bord de la rivière Swan plus tard aujourd'hui." (The exact wording might vary slightly based on the model version).
