How to Run:

Save the code above into a file named run_sentiment.py.
Open your Ubuntu terminal.
Make sure your virtual environment (if you created one) is activated (source .venv/bin/activate).
Run the script using Python:
Bash

python run_sentiment.py
What to Expect:

First Run: It will print "Loading model..." and then likely pause for a while as it downloads the model files (a few hundred MB) from the Hugging Face Hub to your cache (~/.cache/huggingface/hub). You'll see download progress bars. After downloading, it will perform the analysis and print the results.
Subsequent Runs: It will load the model much faster from your local cache and then perform the analysis.
