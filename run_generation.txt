Text Generation.

This script will use a pre-trained model (GPT-2 by default) to generate text based on a starting prompt you provide.

Prerequisites:

Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed:

Bash

pip install transformers torch
# Or: pip install transformers tensorflow

How to Run:

Save the code above into a file named run_generation.py.
Open your Ubuntu terminal.
Make sure your virtual environment (if used) is activated (source .venv/bin/activate).
Run the script:
Bash

python run_generation.py
What to Expect:

First Run: It will download the gpt2 model files (which are larger than the sentiment model, potentially >500MB) and cache them locally. This might take some time.
Generation: It will then use the loaded model to continue the text starting from your prompt ("Thinking about the beautiful weather...").
Output: It will print the complete text (prompt + generated continuation) up to the max_length specified. Since num_return_sequences is 1, it will print one possible completion.
