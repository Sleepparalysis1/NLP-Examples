# NLP Examples: A Collection of AI Scripts ðŸ¤–

![NLP Examples](https://img.shields.io/badge/NLP%20Examples-Collection%20of%20AI%20Scripts-blue)

Welcome to the **NLP Examples** repository! This project features a variety of Python scripts that demonstrate how to run various AI tasks locally. We utilize models from the Hugging Face Hub and the transformers library, along with related libraries like datasets and sentence-transformers. Our examples cover a range of modalities, including text, vision, and audio, showcasing different models and pipelines.

## Features

- **Text Processing**: Utilize state-of-the-art NLP models like BERT for tasks such as text classification and sentiment analysis.
- **Audio Processing**: Explore automatic speech recognition (ASR) models to transcribe audio files into text.
- **Vision Tasks**: Implement models like DETR for object detection in images.
- **Comprehensive Examples**: Each script is self-contained and includes detailed comments to guide you through the code.

## Installation

To get started, you'll need to set up your environment. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sleepparalysis1/NLP-Examples.git
   cd NLP-Examples
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   Use `pip` to install the required libraries.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Each script in this repository serves a specific purpose. You can run them directly from the command line. For example, to run a text classification script, use:

```bash
python text_classification.py --input "Your text here"
```

Make sure to check the script for additional options.

## Examples

### Text Classification with BERT

This example shows how to use a BERT model for text classification.

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification
import torch

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Prepare input
inputs = tokenizer("Hello, world!", return_tensors="pt")

# Get predictions
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    predictions = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1)

print(f"Predicted class: {predictions.item()}")
```

### Automatic Speech Recognition

This example demonstrates how to transcribe audio using an ASR model.

```python
from transformers import Wav2Vec2ForCTC, Wav2Vec2Tokenizer
import torch

# Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
tokenizer = Wav2Vec2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h')
model = Wav2Vec2ForCTC.from_pretrained('facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h')

# Load audio file
audio_input = "path/to/audio.wav"

# Transcribe audio
input_values = tokenizer(audio_input, return_tensors="pt").input_values
with torch.no_grad():
    logits = model(input_values).logits

# Get predicted ids
predicted_ids = torch.argmax(logits, dim=-1)

# Decode the ids to text
transcription = tokenizer.batch_decode(predicted_ids)
print(f"Transcription: {transcription[0]}")
```

### Object Detection with DETR

This example illustrates how to use the DETR model for object detection.

```python
from transformers import DetrImageProcessor, DetrForObjectDetection
import torch
from PIL import Image

# Load pre-trained model and processor
processor = DetrImageProcessor.from_pretrained("facebook/detr-resnet-50")
model = DetrForObjectDetection.from_pretrained("facebook/detr-resnet-50")

# Load image
image = Image.open("path/to/image.jpg")

# Prepare input
inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")

# Get predictions
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)

# Process outputs
# (Add code to visualize results)
```
